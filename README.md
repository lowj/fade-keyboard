This program makes your mac books keyboard lights fade in and out.
Its fully customizable so you can change the pattern, speed, and smoothness.

Compatability
I know it works on the types of keyboards the 2015, 2013 MacBook pro retina have.

How to install
1. Click on the green button that says clone or download. Click on download zip.
2. Unzip the zip file. and obtain the "fade-keyboard-master" folder. Make sure the name is exact, if not, rename it.
3. Put the "fade-keyboard-master" folder into your home directory. The home directory can be accessed by going to "Go" in the menu bar of finder or by using the keyboard shortcut "shift + command + H" while in finder.
4. Go into the "fade-keyboard-master" folder and take out the file called "fade". Opening this file will start the program, so put it somewhere convenient like the dock or desktop. "fade" runs assuming that "fade-keyboard-master" is in your home directory. If you put it somewhere else make sure to change it to the right directory.
5. Just open the "fade" file to start the program
6. In some cases, your macbook will likely not let run the "fade" program since it was download from the internet. You can either change your security settings by going into system prefrences-->Security & Privacy-->General and change where to allow apps downloaded from. If you do not feel safe changing these settings you can always run the program by going to the terminal and running "cd ~/fade-keyboard-master/ && ./equation". This essentially all the "fade" file does, except it puts it into a more convenient executable file.
7. To stop just go to the terminal window and press "control + C". Then close the window.
